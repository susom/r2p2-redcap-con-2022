### What is R2P2?
The RIT Portal is a web platform that coordinates applications, services, and support for researchers working with the Research IT team and Stanford Technology and Digital Solutions (TDS). Research IT is hoping to use R2P2 to facilitate better management of projects, track issues more thoroughly, and ensure easier communication with RIT personnel.




### What is the REDCap R2P2 Dashboard?
The R2P2 Dashboard links your REDCap project(s) to R2P2.  You can link multiple REDCap projects to the same R2P2 Project.  Integration of REDCap with R2P2 allows you to create and view support tickets, and displays your current project external module pricing, and coordinate payment for REDCap maintenance all from one location.
